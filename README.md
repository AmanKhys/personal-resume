## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a backend-focused web developer who builds efficient and scalable applications using Golang. I follow the Go philosophy closely, writing modular, minimalistic, and production-ready code. My projects range from RESTful APIs and full-stack platforms to system utilities. Every line of code is a learning step toward better control, security, and reliability.

## 🚀 Projects

### **Multi-Vendor E-commerce Platform**

Built a feature-rich, production-level multi-vendor e-commerce platform using Go’s `net/http` standard library without any frameworks. Designed with modular architecture to manage authentication, multiple user roles (admin, vendor, customer), cart operations, dynamic product filtering, order flow, address handling, and Razorpay payment gateway.&#x20;

Got to learn context package by passing Context through middleware for role-based access for authentication. SQLC provides strongly-typed database interactions. Entire architecture reflects idiomatic Go design principles.

The application works entirely on the backend except for Google Authentication, payment, sales report.
